## Collision Game

## Introduction
This game was the final assignment of the course 'programmeermethoden', which is a first-year course on introduction in Python for physicists and astronomers. If you want to play the game, you have to run the 'menu.py' file.

## Rules
The goal of the game is to kick all the balls off the map. 
Except for X.
All the 0's in the map are empty spaces.
The ones are walls and the letters are balls.
You can move the ball X by typing the direction
(R for right, L for left, U for up and D for down)
and the number of times the ball has to go in that direction.

If the ball hits a wall (1), it changes in direction.
If it hits another ball, all the momentum goes in that other ball.
The player starts with 1000 points. For every action 100 points get subtracted.
For every ball that is kicked off the map, the player gains 1000 points.
The player wins when all the balls are off the map.
The player loses if the ball X falls off the map or when he has 0 points.
